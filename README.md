## 📖 Overview

The **AI Complaint Triage System** is a full-stack project designed to help companies automate customer complaint management.

When a customer submits a complaint, the system uses AI to automatically:

✔ Categorize the issue (e.g., Delivery, Payment, Login, Refunds, Product Quality)  
✔ Detect sentiment (Angry, Neutral, Positive)  
✔ Assign a priority (High / Medium / Low)  
✔ Route the complaint to the right internal team (e.g., Logistics, Billing, Tech Support)  
✔ Display all insights on a beautiful dashboard with charts  

This is the same kind of system used by companies like **Amazon, Swiggy, Flipkart, Meesho, Netflix**, etc.
